<h1>Project Assignment II: Ecosystem Simulation</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

Allow students to acquire sensibility and practical experience with
parallel programming for shared memory environments.

<h2>Description</h2>

The problem to be solved consists in the simulation of a simple
ecosystem inhabited by two species of animals, foxes and rabbits,
whose existence over generations is mutually dependent.
<p>
The simulation should be done using a matrix of R rows and C columns
(the ecosystem world), where each cell represents the ecosystem space
on which foxes and rabbits move. In each generation, each cell may be
free or occupied. A cell can be occupied by a fox, a rabbit or a
rock. The world is initialized with a given population of foxes,
rabbits and rocks which, over the generations, evolves accordingly to
a fixed set of rules. The simulation starts with a given initial
ecosystem, and builds the successive generations of foxes and rabbits
until a given number of generations (N_GEN) is reached.

</p><h3>Rules for Rabbits</h3>

<ul><li>
Rabbits can move horizontally or vertically (i.e., north, east, south
and west directions), but not diagonally.
</li><li> 
In each generation, rabbits attempt to move themselves to an empty
adjacent cell. If there are many empty adjacent cells, they choose one
accordingly to a common criteria for selecting adjacent cells (see
below). If there is no empty adjacent cell, they stay in the same
place.
</li><li>
Rabbits can procreate whenever GEN_PROC_RABBITS generations have
passed since they were born or since they last procreated. Whenever a
rabbit reaches such age (to procreate) and makes a move, it leaves in
its last position a new rabbit and both rabbits' procreation age is
set to zero.
</li></ul>

<h3>Rules for Foxes</h3>

<ul><li>
Foxes can move horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
</li><li>
In each generation, foxes try to eat a rabbit by moving to an adjacent
cell that is occupied by a rabbit. If there are many adjacent cells
occupied with rabbits, they choose one accordingly to the common
criteria for selecting adjacent cells (see below). If there is no
adjacent cell occupied by a rabbit, foxes attempt to move themselves
to an empty adjacent cell by following the same criteria. If there is
no adjacent cell occupied with a rabbit or empty, they stay in the
same place.
</li><li>
Foxes starve and die whenever GEN_FOOD_FOXES generations have passed
since they were born or since they last ate a rabbit. Foxes die after
not finding a rabbit to eat and before attempting to move themselves
to an empty adjacent cell.
</li><li>
Foxes can procreate whenever GEN_PROC_FOXES generations have passed
since they were born or since they last procreated. Whenever a fox
reaches such age (to procreate) and makes a move, it leaves in its
last position a new fox and both foxes' procreation age is set to
zero.
</li></ul>

<h3>Rules for Rocks</h3>

<ul><li>
Rocks do not move and no animal can occupy its space.
</li></ul>

<h3>Criteria for Selecting Adjacent Cells</h3>

<ul><li> 
By following the clockwise order, start numbering from 0 the possible
P cells to where a fox/rabbit can move (adjacent north, east,
south and west cells).
</li><li>
Let G represent the current generation and (X,Y) represent the cell
coordinates where a fox/rabbit is positioned in the ecosystem space,
then the adjacent cell to be chosen is determined by (G+X+Y) mod
P. Assume that the initial generation is number 0 and that the world
origin is (0,0).
</li></ul>

<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>

In each generation, start by moving the set of rabbits and only after
the set of foxes. When moving the set of rabbits/foxes, you should
assume as if all the rabbits/foxes move at same time, i.e., the
particular order by which the rabbits/foxes are moved should not
affect the final result. However, during the movement within a
generation, it may happen that several rabbits/foxes try to move to
the same cells. When this happens, you should apply the following
rules:
<ul><li> 
When two or more rabbits move to the same cell, only the one with the
older procreation age (GEN_PROC_RABBITS) is kept and all the other
rabbits die.
</li><li> 
When two or more foxes move to the same cell, only the one with the
older procreation age (GEN_PROC_FOXES) is kept and all the other foxes
die. If there are two or more foxes with the same procreation age, we
keep the least hungry fox (GEN_FOOD_FOXES).
</li></ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Start by implementing a sequential version of the application and only
then develop a parallel implementation for shared memory
environments. For that, you can use processes combined with shared
memory segments or threads by using the Pthreads or OpenMP programming
models.
<p>
For the parallel implementation, start with simple strategies,
e.g. having each worker responsible for the moves of a fixed portion
of the world. Note that at the end of each generation, it may be
required to synchronize data with adjacent workers about foxes and
rabbits that moved from the space of one worker to the space of
another. You can also split the matrix horizontally, vertically or in
both dimensions in a static way, although more efficient solutions
should be adaptive to dynamically balance the workload among the
executing workers.

</p><h2>Input and Output</h2>

The application to be developed must accept as input a file with the
configuration parameters and the description of the initial state of
the ecosystem. Such description must obey the following pattern: the
first input line has all the configuration parameters (including an
integer N representing the number of objects in the initial
ecosystem), followed by N lines each representing one object of the
initial ecosystem. The configuration parameters are the following (by
order):

<ul><li>
GEN_PROC_RABBITS - number of generations until a rabbit can procreate
</li><li>
GEN_PROC_FOXES - number of generations until a fox can procreate
</li><li>
GEN_FOOD_FOXES - number of generations for a fox to die of starvation
</li><li>
N_GEN - number of generations for the simulation
</li><li>
R - number of rows of the matrix representing the ecosystem
</li><li>
C - number of columns of the matrix representing the ecosystem
</li><li>
N - number of objects in the initial ecosystem
</li></ul>

The objects in the initial ecosystem are given using the format OBJECT
X Y where OBJECT can be ROCK, FOX or RABBIT, and X and Y are the
coordinates where the OBJECT is positioned in the matrix. An input
example is:
<pre>2 4 3 6 5 5 9
ROCK 0 0
RABBIT 0 2
FOX 0 4
FOX 1 0
FOX 1 4
ROCK 2 4
RABBIT 3 0
RABBIT 4 0
FOX 4 4
</pre>
The application should write to the standard output the description of
the final state of the ecosystem, following the same format as the one
used for the input. For the given example, the output should be:
<pre>2 4 3 0 5 5 5
ROCK 0 0
ROCK 2 4
RABBIT 3 0
FOX 4 0
FOX 4 3
</pre>
In more detail, for the given example, the sequence of generations is as follows:
<pre>Gen 0     Gen 1     Gen 2     Gen 3     Gen 4     Gen 5     Gen 6
-------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------
|* R F|   |*R F |   |* F  |   |*  F |   |*   F|   |*    |   |*    |
|F   F|   |   F |   |  F  |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |
|    *|   |F   *|   |    *|   |    *|   |    *|   |    *|   |    *|
|R    |   | R  F|   |F    |   |     |   | R   |   |R    |   |R    |
|R   F|   | R   |   |  R F|   |FRR  |   | F R |   | FF  |   |F  F |
-------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------
</pre>
The input file must be read from the standard input and the results
are to be printed to the standard output
(click <b><a href="https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~miguel-areias/teaching/2526/cp/labs/ecosystem_examples.zip">here</a></b> to
